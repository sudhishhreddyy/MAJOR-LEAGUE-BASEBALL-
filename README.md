Unlocking Baseball Insights with Advanced SQL Analytics and CTEs

⚾ Major League Baseball Data Analysis using SQL

This project presents an in-depth analysis of Major League Baseball (MLB) player and team data using advanced SQL queries. It leverages key techniques such as:

- ✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- ✅ Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
- ✅ Aggregate and Analytical Queries
- ✅ Joins, Filtering, and Grouping for insights
- ✅ Performance statistics and team comparisons

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze player debut and final game stats
- Track salary progression across years and teams
- Identify top-performing players per team and season
- Perform cumulative spend analysis using window functions

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible)
- DBMS (e.g., MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin)
- MLB datasets (e.g., Lahman's Baseball Database)
